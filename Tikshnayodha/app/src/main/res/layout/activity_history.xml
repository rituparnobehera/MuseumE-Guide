            android:text="Manchester United Football Club is an English professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester.
The club was formed in Newton Heath in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR F.C., and played their first competitive match in
October 1886, when they entered the First Round of the 1886â€“87 FA Cup. The club was renamed Manchester United F.C.
in 1902, and moved to Old Trafford in 1910. Since playing their first competitive match, exactly 900 players have
made a competitive first-team appearance for the club, of whom 204 players have made at least 100 appearances (including substitute appearances).
Manchester United's record appearance-maker is Ryan Giggs, who made a total of 963 appearances over a 23-year
playing career; he broke Bobby Charlton's previous appearance record in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final.
Giggs also holds the record for the most starts, having started in 797 games. Charlton was the club's top
goalscorer with 249 goals in his 17 years with the club which was overtaken by Wayne Rooney having 250 goals in
his tally, when he scored through a free kick against Stoke. Seven other players have made more than 500 appearances,
including three members of the 1968 European Cup-winning team and three members of the 1999
Treble-winning team. Other than Charlton and Rooney, only two players have scored more than 200 goals for the club."
